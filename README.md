# Predicting-Nigeria-s-GDP
Using multiple linear regression to predict the economy of Nigeria.

This Project tries to examine 7 factors that affect the GDP of nigeria, these factors include:
1. Oil Revenue
2. Import Rate
3. Export Rate
4. Fedral Government Expenditure
5. Fedral Direct Investments
6. Exchange Rate
7. Population

Extensive feature selection is employed using Ordinary Least Square method to determine which factors least affect the outcome of the GDP.
A multiple linear regression model is then created using **Population**, **Oil revenue**, and **Import rate** as forecast variables against GDP as predicted variable.
An overall 84% model accuracy is achieved.

### Description of Files
The file containing the source code is a jupyter notebook file
> Predicting GDP

The Folder **Datasets** contains all datasets used in the project

### Packages Required
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

I recommend using the open data science platform **Anaconda** To run the .ipynb file.
